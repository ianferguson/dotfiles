==== Postgres Configuration Files ====

== If you're reading this from a git repo ==
- Currently these files are extremely close to the 9.4 defaults, but I wanted to start tracking changes I made on all local pg installs
- This package is not (currently) stowed out to anywhere by default, but that may be something worth doing later

== If you're reading this from a pg data directory ==
- You'll notice several key configuration files are symlinked from a git repo that has github.com/ianferguson/dotfiles as a repo, 
  hopefully this is not a problem or a surprise.
